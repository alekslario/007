12.01.2024 - First sprint
We discussed with Sean what we were going to do the following week and agreed that we need to divide the project into small manageable chunks. For the next week, we are going to focus on creating a barebones functional prototype - querying the weather data and displaying the data on the screen of a bootstrapped app.
