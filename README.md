**ABSTRACT**
Weather apps offer users weather information, and the effectiveness of an
app is dependent on the accuracy of its data. Weather apps rely on third-party
APIs, which, in turn, often depend on traditional methods of weather
forecasting. Until recently, AI models didnâ€™t perform as well as traditional
methods of weather forecasting. This project aims to create an advanced AI
weather app that uses the latest technologies, with a specific focus on design.
The project focuses on understanding the limits and progress of AI models for
weather predictions. We compare existing weather apps to identify their
features, limitations, and areas for improvement. Face-to-face surveys were
conducted at various stages to collect vital information and evaluate the app's
navigation, accessibility, and functionality.
Results indicated widespread approval among participants for the layout,
colour scheme, navigation, functionality, and overall importance of the
application. Taking into account the numerous feedback received, we
implemented changes to enhance the prototype.
